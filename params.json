Then, by checking against several rules, it\r\ndecides whether a recipient was added in mistake - and if so - alerts\r\nyou with a friendly popup.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the rules is: \"alert when sending an email with a\r\nrecipient inside the company in the TO line, and one or more\r\nrecipients from OUTSIDE the company in CC\". This makes sense because\r\nin most internal emails there is no need to CC recipients from outside\r\nthe company, and if an external recipient is CCed - it might be a\r\npersonal contact, a supplier, or even a client that you don't want to\r\nexpose the internal communication to.\r\n\r\nOnce alerted, if you decide to go ahead and send the email anyway -\r\nSendRight will automatically remember the list of recipients that you\r\napproved and will not alert you again when sending to them.\r\n\r\nIn other words - SendRight will quickly learn your emailing habits and\r\neventually you will very rarely see \"wrong\" alerts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Privacy\r\n\r\nSendRight relies only on the recipients list and does not look at the\r\ncontent of your emails at all.\r\n\r\nSendRight is open source and anyone is welcome to look at the code and\r\ncompile their own version for themselves or for their company.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSendRight is useful right out of the box. It automatically deduces\r\nyour company domain by looking at your Outlook accounts and is ready\r\nto protect you without further configuration.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to adjust the rules and do some other cool\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\nOpen the Settings popup or disable SendRight (until Outlook is\r\nrestarted) from the SendRight ribbon:\r\n\r\n![Ribbon](http://www.sendright.email/images/ribbon.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### First use\r\n\r\nThe first time you start Outlook after running the installer, the\r\nSendRight settings window will pop up automatically:\r\n\r\n![Settings - Welcome](http://www.sendright.email/images/settings/welcome.png)\r\n\r\nNotice the checkbox at the bottom; if checked - SendRight will add\r\na short line of text to the end of every new email you create. You will\r\nsee this line when you edit the email and will be able to remove it.\r\nThis is a good way to let peers and other recipients know that you take\r\nemail privacy seriously and encourage others to do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Controlled Domains\r\n\r\nA \"Controlled Domain\" is a domain that will be protected by SendRight.\r\nMost users have a single Controlled Domain that is the domain of their\r\ncompany. When one or more of the recipients email addresses are at a\r\nControlled Domain - SendRight will test the recipients list against the\r\nrules and alert if necessary.\r\n\r\n![Settings - Controlled Domains](http://www.sendright.email/images/settings/controlledDomains.png)\r\n\r\nFor example, if you configure \"mycompany.com\" as your Controlled Domain,\r\nSendRight would alert if you send an email to \"joe@mycompany.com\" with\r\n\"jane@anothercompany.com\" in the recipients list.\r\n\r\nYou can have any number of Controlled Domains, and each would be\r\nreviewed separately; if you have two Controlled Domains: \"mycompany.com\"\r\nand \"myothercompany.com\" - an email to recipients in both of those\r\ndomains would raise an alert.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to have a list of domains be considered as a single\r\ndomain by specifying them in the Controlled Domain(s) text box,\r\nseparated by a comma:\r\n\r\n![Settings - Multiple Controlled Domains](http://www.sendright.email/images/settings/controlledDomains.multiple.png)\r\n\r\nThis is useful if your company has multiple domains. For example, if you \r\nset \"mycompany.com\" and \"mycompany.biz\" together, they will be treated\r\nas synonyms and sending to recipients in both domain in the same email\r\nwill not raise an alert.\r\n\r\nSuppose that you send an email to \"joe@mycompany.com\" and to\r\n\"jane@anothercompany.com\":\r\n\r\n![Email](http://www.sendright.email/images/email1.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you try to send it, you will get this alert:\r\n\r\n![Email](http://www.sendright.email/images/email1.risks.png)\r\n\r\nIf you click on SEND - the email will send, and an exception will be\r\nadded for the relevant Controlled Domains so that in the future, emails\r\nsent to both \"joe@mycompany.com\" and \"jane@anothercompany.com\" will no\r\nlonger trigger an alert:\r\n\r\n![Settings - Controlled Domains - Exception](http://www.sendright.email/images/settings/controlledDomains.exception.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rules\r\n\r\nSendRight offers six different rules:\r\n\r\n![Settings - Rules](http://www.sendright.email/images/settings/rules.png)\r\n\r\nEach rule can be enabled or disabled and some of the rules have\r\nparameters that can be adjusted:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Warn when emailing protected addresses\r\n\r\nIt is possible to pop up an alert whenever emailing a protected address.\r\nThis can prevent accidentally sending an email to a sensitive address\r\n**inside** the company. A while back there was a story going around\r\nabout a CFO that accidentally emailed the company's salary sheet to\r\nall@ address.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Warn when emailing move than N recipients\r\n\r\nWhen emailing a lot of people it may be useful to receive an alert and\r\nhave a chance to reconsider whether they should all be in the\r\ncorrespondence, or even just to just have another quick review of the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Warn when emailing multiple addresses that are **not** in a Controlled Domain\r\n\r\nThis rule applies to all emails, regardless of the Controlled Domains\r\nconfiguration. For example, it will alert when sending to\r\n\"joe@somecompany.com\" and \"jane@someothercompany.com\". The idea is\r\nthat many emails are not meant for people not in the same company.\r\nFor example, when emailing a client and accidentally putting another\r\nclient in the CC.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Warn when there is a Controlled Domain in the TO line and one or more non-Controlled Domains in CC or BCC\r\n\r\nThis rule is similar to the previous one, but only takes effect when\r\nthere is an address at a Controlled Domain in the TO line.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Warn when the TO line has both Controlled Domains and non-Controlled Domains\r\n\r\nSimilar to the above rule, but pertains specifically to the TO line.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Warn when sending email from an address that is not in a list\r\n\r\nYou should put your own email address (or email addresses) in this\r\nrule's text box. For example, it may be useful to be notified when\r\nsending out of an addresses such as \"support@mycompany.com\" in case\r\nit's being done in mistake (e.g. when replying internally to an email\r\nreceived at the support mailbox)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\n\r\nSendRight collects simple statistics of how many emails it reviewed,\r\nhow many violated a rule, and how many times you decided to cancel the\r\nsend after receiving the alert.\r\n\r\n![Settings - Statistics](http://www.sendright.email/images/settings/statistics.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Export / Import\r\n\r\nIt's possible to export all of the settings (including all Controlled\r\nDomains, all of the exceptions, all of the statistics, etc...) to a\r\nfile and then import them on another computer.\r\n",
